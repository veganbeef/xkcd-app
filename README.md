# XKCD Viewer

This demo application uses [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) on the backend and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on the frontend to scrape, store, and display [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comics, with optional searching by title, alt text, and upload date.

See the README files in _backend/_ and _frontend/_ for info on how to run the development servers.
